# Our Issues
[ourissu.es](http://ourissu.es) is an open source initiative to visualize the concerns people have across the world. People can utilize this tool to represent their area and the issues that affect them on a daily basis. Then community leaders can analyze issues and see what their impact is.

This is a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) application. It divides the project into a distinct [frontend](https://github.com/Parth-Mehrotra/ourissu.es/tree/master/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/Parth-Mehrotra/ourissu.es/tree/master/backend). The frontend utilizes [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an interactive mapping library.
